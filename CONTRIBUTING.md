## Contributing

We would absolutely love to get the community involved, and we welcome any form of contributions – comments and questions on different communication channels, issues and pull request and anything that you build and share using our components.

### Communication channels
* Communication is primarily done using issues.

### Ways to help
* **Report bugs**<br/>Create an issue or send a pull request
* **Send pull requests**<br/>If you want to contribute code, check out the development instructions below.
  * However when contributing new features, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change. Otherwise your work might be rejected and your effort was pointless.

We also encourage you to read the [contribution instructions by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

## Releasing [![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/litetex-oss/mcm-raid-restore/release.yml?branch=master)](https://github.com/litetex-oss/mcm-raid-restore/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Before releasing:
* Consider doing a [test-deployment](https://github.com/litetex-oss/mcm-raid-restore/actions/workflows/test-deploy.yml?query=branch%3Adev) before actually releasing.
* Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

If ``dev`` is ready for release, create a pull request to the ``master``-Branch and merge the changes

When the release is finished do the following:
* Merge the auto-generated PR (with the incremented version number) back into ``dev``
