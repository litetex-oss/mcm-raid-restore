## Resource gathering times
Imagine you have a big redstone project that requires a full Shulkerbox of Redstone blocks (27 x 64 x 9 = ~16k Redstone) or you need lots of Emeralds for trading.<br/>
How do you get those resources in 1.21+?

### Options in 1.20

### Conclusion for 1.21
As we can see without stacking Raid farms collecting these resources takes a lot longer or becomes way harder (no AFK).

Update [24w20a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_24w20a):<br/>
Witch farms got buffed by a factor of 3 to 6, which makes redstone farming now more viable. However compared to a 1.20 stacking raid farm this is still only 25% of the redstone output.

## The nerf itself
Although no explicit reason have been stated why stacked raid farms have been nerfed (they could have just kept the Bad Omen mechanic, maybe shorten the effect duration when killing a Raider to ~3 minutes - from 100 - and drop the bottle additionally), it's likely caused by the fact that parts of the community are complaining that these are too "overpowered/cheaty/illegal". (Quite the same happened for AFK fish farms in 1.16 - but you had Villager trading as an viable alternative)

IMHO this is the wrong way to go, as this change just causes negative effects:
1. It makes the game harder: "Very advanced players" (that need a lot of resources) now have no viable alternative. Do you like to mine/trade with villagers for hours or AFK for a lot longer? No? Well in 1.21 you have to. This can be very demotivating.
2. Stacked raid farms may be relatively easy to build (it still takes some hours to build them), but only so because (other) people did a lot of research and engineering on that mechanic.
3. Just because the mechanic exists doesn't mean that you HAVE to use it. I bet that most casual players don't even know/care about it. You can play the game in the way that you like.<br/>So I kind of don't understand why some people that complain about how other people play the game now get what they want despite having no positive effects for them and just bad ones for others.

* > If you don't like them, don't use them. It's not like anyone is preventing you from build a witch farm instead. No need to ruin everyone else's fun just because you prefer to play differently.<sup>[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/r1yaee/comment/hm4seea)</sup>
* > Don’t like it, don’t build it is my opinion. If we plan on asking Mojang to nerf any farm/mechanic we don’t personally like or use ourselves things would be incredibly messy and nothing but nonstop arguments about what stays and what’s “cheating/too over powered.”<sup>[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/xab4ja/comment/insvopo)</sup>

* > I do think it is OP, but the fact that you can build a farm this powerful with so little effort should be considered an achievement of the technical community, because they did the research, the design, and they exploited the code in just the right way <sup>[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/xarqd9/comment/inwasb5)</sup>
